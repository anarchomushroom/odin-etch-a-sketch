An app to simulate using an Etch-a-Sketch. Hovering over a portion of the sketchpad will change that section from white to black. Users can click the "New Sketchpad" button to generate a new sketchpad with a different number of "pixels" without changing the size of the sketchpad itself.

# Add Ons and Improvements
* Add styling
* Stop users from entering non-number characters for new size
* Change available colours you can use
* Add slider for new Sketchpad size
* Add a button to clear the current Sketchpad without changing the size
